# writeless

This is just a test repository to experiment using native RN libraries and Expo after eject.

This is a repository that contains the official `writeless` app that is found in [this repository](https://github.com/Writeless-project/writeless). 

## Installation

Android is **NOT** supported. It is only supported in iOS. Because of this, you will need a computer with MacOS and XCode installed. 

`Cocoapods` is highl recommended for this project. More information can be found [here](https://cocoapods.org/).

```sh
# assuming that we are already in the writeless repository
$ cd ios/
$ pod install
```

It does take a while for all of the dependencies to install but patience is important here! :) Once the installation is complete, open `writeless.xcworkspace` and just press `âŒ˜R` or the Play button to begin building the project.
